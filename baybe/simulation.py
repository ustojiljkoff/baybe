"""Functionality to "simulate" Bayesian DOE given a lookup mechanism.

The term "simulation" can have two slightly different interpretations, depending on the
applied context:

*   It can refer to "backtesting" a particular DOE strategy on a fixed (finite)
    dataset. In this context, "simulation" means investigating what experimental
    trajectory we would have observed if we had applied the strategy in a certain
    defined context and restricted the possible parameter configurations to those
    contained in the dataset.

*   It can refer to the simulation of an actual DOE loop (i.e. recommending experiments
    and retrieving the corresponding measurements) where the loop closure is realized
    in the form of a callable (black-box) function that can be queried during the
    optimization to provide target values.

    **NOTE:**
    Currently, the simulation only supports purely discrete search spaces. This is
    because ``lookup`` serves both as the loop-closing element **and** as the source
    for off-task training data. For continuous (or mixed) spaces, the lookup mechanism
    would need to be either implemented as a callable (in which case the training data
    must be provided separately) or the continuous parameters need to be effectively
    restricted to the finite number of provided lookup configurations. Neither is

    The most basic type of simulation. Runs a single execution of the loop either

        lookup: The lookup used to close the loop, provided in the form of a dataframe
            or callable that define the targets for the queried parameter settings:
            First, a dataframe containing experimental settings and their target
            results can be chosen.
            Second, A callable, providing target values for the given parameter
            settings. can be chosen. The callable is assumed to return either a float
            or a tuple of floats and to accept an arbitrary number of floats as input.
            Finally,``None`` can be chosen, producing fake results.
        batch_quantity: The number of recommendations to be queried per iteration.
        n_doe_iterations:  The number of iterations to run the design-of-experiments

        initial_data: The initial measurement data to be ingested before starting the
            loop.
        random_seed: The random seed used for the simulation.
        impute_mode: Specifies how a missing lookup will be handled.
            There are six different options available.

            - ``"error"``: An error will be thrown.
            - ``"worst"``: Imputation uses the worst available value for each target.
            - ``"best"``: Imputation uses the best available value for each target.
            - ``"mean"``: Imputation uses the mean value for each target.
            - ``"random"``: A random row will be used as lookup.
            - ``"ignore"``: The search space is stripped before recommendations are made
              so that unmeasured experiments will not be recommended.
        noise_percent: If not ``None``, relative noise in percent of
            ``noise_percent`` will be applied to the parameter measurements.

        A dataframe ready for plotting, see the ``Note`` for details.

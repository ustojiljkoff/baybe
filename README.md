# BayBE — A Bayesian Back End for Design of Experiments

The Bayesian Back End (**BayBE**) provides a general-purpose toolbox for Bayesian Design
of Experiments, focusing on additions that enable real-world experimental campaigns.

Besides functionality to perform a typical recommend-measure loop, BayBE's highlights are:
- Custom parameter encodings: Improve your campaign with domain knowledge
- Built-in chemical encodings: Improve your campaign with chemical knowledge
- Single and multiple targets with min, max and match objectives
- Custom surrogate models: For specialized problems or active learning
- Hybrid (mixed continuous and discrete) spaces
- Transfer learning: Mix data from multiple campaigns and accelerate optimization
- Comprehensive backtest, simulation and imputation utilities: Benchmark and find your best settings
- Fully typed and hypothesis-tested: Robust code base
- All objects are fully de-/serializable: Useful for storing results in databases or use in wrappers like APIs

## Installation
### From Package Index
The easiest way to install BayBE is via PyPI:

```bash
pip install baybe
```

A certain released version of the package can installed by specifying the
corresponding version tag in the form `baybe==x.y.z`.

### From GitHub
If you need finer control and would like to install a specific commit that has not been
released under a certain version tag, you can do so by installing BayBE directly from
GitHub via git and specifying the corresponding 
[git ref](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/vcs-support/#git). 

For instance, to install the latest commit of the main branch, run:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/emdgroup/baybe.git@main
```


### From Local Clone

Alternatively, you can install the package from your own local copy.
First, clone the repository, navigate to the repository root folder, check out the
desired commit, and run:

```bash
pip install .
```

A developer would typically also install the package in editable mode ('-e'),
which ensures that changes to the code do not require a reinstallation.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

If you need to add additional dependencies, make sure to use the correct syntax 
including `''`:

```bash
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

### Optional Dependencies
There are several dependency groups that can be selected during pip installation, like
```bash
pip install 'baybe[test,lint]' # will install baybe with additional dependency groups `test` and `lint`
```
To get the most out of `baybe`, we recommend to install at least
```bash
pip install 'baybe[chem,simulation]'
```

The available groups are:
- `chem`: Cheminformatics utilities (e.g. for the `SubstanceParameter`).
- `docs`: Required for creating the documentation.
- `examples`: Required for running the examples/streamlit.
- `lint`: Required for linting and formatting.
- `mypy`: Required for static type checking.
- `onnx`: Required for using custom surrogate models in [ONNX format](https://onnx.ai).
- `simulation`: Enabling the [simulation](https://emdgroup.github.io/baybe/_autosummary/baybe.simulation.html) module.
- `test`: Required for running the tests.
- `dev`: All of the above plus `tox` and `pip-audit`. For code contributors.
  
### BayBE with a venv, full code
```bash
conda create --name baybe_venv python=3.11
conda activate baybe_venv
pip install baybe[chem,docs,examples,lint,mypy,onnx,simulation,test]
```

## Quick Start

Let us consider a simple experiment where we have three parameters and want to maximize 
a single target called `Yield`.

### Defining the Optimization Objective

In BayBE's language, the `Yield` can be represented as a `NumericalTarget`,
which we pass into an `Objective`.

```python
from baybe.targets import NumericalTarget
from baybe.objective import Objective

target = NumericalTarget(
    name="Yield",
    mode="MAX",
)
objective = Objective(mode="SINGLE", targets=[target])
```

In cases where we need to consider multiple (potentially competing) targets, the
role of the `Objective` is to define additional settings, e.g. how these targets should
be balanced.
In `SINGLE` mode, however, there are no additional settings.
For more details, see 
[the objective section of the user guide](https://emdgroup.github.io/baybe/userguide/objective.html).

### Defining the Search Space

Next, we inform BayBE about the available "control knobs", that is, the underlying
system parameters we can tune to optimize our targets. This also involves specifying 
their values/ranges and other parameter-specific details.

For our example, we assume that we can control the following three quantities:

```python
from baybe.parameters import (
    CategoricalParameter,
    NumericalDiscreteParameter,
    SubstanceParameter,
)

parameters = [
    CategoricalParameter(
        name="Granularity",
        values=["coarse", "medium", "fine"],
        encoding="OHE", # one-hot encoding of categories
    ),
    NumericalDiscreteParameter(
        name="Pressure[bar]",
        values=[1, 5, 10],
        tolerance=0.2, # allows experimental inaccuracies up to 0.2 when reading values 
    ),
    SubstanceParameter(
        name="Solvent",
        data={"Solvent A": "COC", "Solvent B": "CCC", # label-SMILES pairs
              "Solvent C": "O", "Solvent D": "CS(=O)C"},
        encoding="MORDRED", # chemical encoding via mordred package
    ),
]
```

For more parameter types and their details, see the
[parameters section of the user guide](https://emdgroup.github.io/baybe/userguide/parameters.html).

Additionally, we can define a set of constraints to further specify allowed ranges and
relationships between our parameters. Details can be found in 
[the constraints section of the user guide](https://emdgroup.github.io/baybe/userguide/constraints.html).
In this example, we assume no further constraints.

With the parameter and constraint definitions at hand, we can now create our
`SearchSpace` based on the Cartesian product of all possible parameter values:

```python
from baybe.searchspace import SearchSpace

searchspace = SearchSpace.from_product(parameters)
```

### Optional: Defining the Optimization Strategy

As an optional step, we can specify details on how the optimization should be
conducted. If omitted, BayBE will choose a default setting.

For our example, we combine two selection strategies:

1. In cases where no measurements have been made prior to the interaction with BayBE,
   a selection via `initial_recommender` is used.
2. As soon as the first measurements are available, we switch to `recommender`.

For more details on the different strategies, their underlying algorithmic
details, and their configuration settings, see
[the strategies section of the user guide](https://emdgroup.github.io/baybe/userguide/strategy.html).

```python
from baybe.strategies import TwoPhaseStrategy
from baybe.recommenders import SequentialGreedyRecommender, FPSRecommender

strategy = TwoPhaseStrategy(
    initial_recommender=FPSRecommender(), # farthest point sampling
    recommender=SequentialGreedyRecommender(), # Bayesian model-based optimization
)
```

### The Optimization Loop

We can now construct a campaign object that brings all pieces of the puzzle together:

```python
from baybe import Campaign

campaign = Campaign(searchspace, objective, strategy)
```

With this object at hand, we can start our experimentation cycle.
In particular:

* We can ask BayBE to `recommend` new experiments.
* We can `add_measurements` for certain experimental settings to the campaign's 
  database.

Note that these two steps can be performed in any order.
In particular, available measurements can be submitted at any time and also several 
times before querying the next recommendations.

```python
df = campaign.recommend(batch_quantity=3)
```

For a particular random seed, the result could look as follows:

| Granularity   | Pressure[bar]   | Solvent   |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------|
| medium        | 1               | Solvent B |
| medium        | 5               | Solvent D |
| fine          | 5               | Solvent C |

After having conducted the corresponding experiments, we can add our measured
targets to the table and feed it back to the campaign:

```python
df["Yield"] = [79.8, 54.1, 59.4]
campaign.add_measurements(df)
```

With the newly arrived data, BayBE can produce a refined design for the next iteration.
This loop would typically continue until a desired target value has been achieved in
the experiment.
